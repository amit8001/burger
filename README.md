# burger
I developed this appalication using Node, Express using MVC design pattern and native/basic ORM approach. This application </br>
allows a user to add a burger that will be initially displayed in the "Not Devoured" section. Then when one clicks on the </br> 
"Devour" button, the entry shows up in the "Already Devoured"section! </br> 
I deployed this app to Heroku as well and please see the gif below to showcase what I developed</br>
